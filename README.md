# 53functions
Functions to prepare coders to do Code Katas. Each coder will have to clone this repository and start to commit the implementation of the functions. A central CI instance will run their functions and give them a score fo reach function based on how many tests are passing.

> Fifty-three is the 16th prime number. It is also an Eisenstein prime, and a Sophie Germain prime. The sum of the first 53 primes is 5830, which is divisible by 53, a property shared by few other numbers.

	* The common field cricket chirps in direct proportion to the current temÂ­perature. Adding 40 to the number of times a cricket chirps in a minute, then dividing by 4, gives us the temperature (in Fahrenheit degrees). Write a program that accepts as input the number of cricket chirps in fifteen seconds, then outputs the current temperature to the nearest half degree. http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/101/HomeworkProblems.html
	* Write a program that gauges inflation. It should accept two prices (in whole dollars as input and print their difference, as well as the percentage increase to two decimal places. Then accept as input the number of weeks between the two prices, and compute the yearly rate of inflation (as percentage increase). http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/101/HomeworkProblems.html
