# 53functions
Functions to prepare coders to do Code Katas. Each coder will have to clone this repository and start to commit the implementation of the functions into it. A central CI instance will run their functions and give them a score for each function based on how many tests are passing. Coders will need to start working on that from very early on in the program.

> Fifty-three is the 16th prime number. It is also an Eisenstein prime, and a Sophie Germain prime. The sum of the first 53 primes is 5830, which is divisible by 53, a property shared by few other numbers.

48|cricket.js| that solves this riddle: The common field cricket chirps in direct proportion to the current temÂ­perature. Adding 40 to the number of times a cricket chirps in a minute, then dividing by 4, gives us the temperature (in Fahrenheit degrees). Write a program that accepts as input the number of cricket chirps in fifteen seconds, then outputs the current temperature to the nearest half degree. http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/101/HomeworkProblems.html
49|filter.js| takes a list of values and a filter function that can filter the list of values - the filtered result should be returned by the function. This function should be able to filter any kind of data, it shouldn't care about the data.
